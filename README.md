### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

When in the thick of it, debugging or exploring a new way of solving a problem, there is a moment of complete focus that I find highly satisfying. On top of it, knowing that no matter how much I learn there will be always so much more to exploreâ€¦  I feel almost giddy with excitement just thinking about future challenges. 

This is why I love software engineering: a vast field of knowledge that requires constant studying, researching, exploring, testing, and building newer and better solutions.
