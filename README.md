### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


After a career in Investment Banking and teaching Economics and Finance, I wanted a new intellectual challenge, so I went back to school and completed a Master's in Information Systems. Thatâ€™s when I found I really liked coding and kept teaching myself and building simple projects. More recently I completed a Software Engineering Immersive at Hack Reactor, where I worked with other software engineers in sprints creating full-stack applications using Agile methodologies. 

Now Iâ€™m excited to work as a software engineer because it is a vast field that requires constant learning, which is exactly what I was looking for.
