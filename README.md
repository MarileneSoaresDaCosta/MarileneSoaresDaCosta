### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


After a career in Investment Banking and teaching Economics and Finance, I wanted a new intellectual challenge, so I went back to school and completed a Master's in Information Systems. Thatâ€™s when I found I loved coding... 

More recently, I completed a Software Engineering Immersive at Hack Reactor, and after that I completed the VMWare's Ascent Technical Program.

When in the thick of it, debugging or exploring a new way of solving a problem, there is a moment of complete focus that I find highly satisfying. On top of it, knowing that no matter how much I learn there will be always so much more to exploreâ€¦  I feel almost giddy with excitement just thinking about my future challenges. 

This is why software engineering is exactly what I was looking for: a vast field of knowledge that requires constant studying, researching, exploring, testing, and building newer and better solutions.

This is why Iâ€™m excited to be a software engineer.
